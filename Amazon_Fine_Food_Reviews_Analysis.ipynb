Very fresh \\\"homemade\\\" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully \\\"explode\\\" or \\\"bloom\\\".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the \\\"healthy\\\" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.
